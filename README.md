# Usage
## macOS Setup
You will need to add an entitlement for either read-only access:

``<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-only</key>
<true/>``

or read-write access:

``<key>com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write</key>
<true/>``

depending on your use case. It may also be necessary to turn off the app-sandbox entitlement.
